# Heading 1 # 
I started unity up then I followed the 2D game kit walk thorugh, link provided: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/2d-game-kit-walkthrough?projectId=5c51481eedbc2a00206944f0.


# Heading 2 #
I created a new scene in Unity. Then added new tile palettes so the player can have more area to move around on the in the game. A moving platform that moves in a loop was made to make the game a little diffcult. I added a door and a pressure pad so the player has to step on the pressure pad to open the door. I added five enemeies throughout the scene/game so the player has to kill the enemies. A pushable box was added so the player could kill one of the enemies by pushig the box and dropping the box on top of the enemy. I also add a teleportation area so the player can teleport to the end of the area where I stopped adding tile palettes. 


# Heading 3 #
I kept the controls the same os the player does not get confuse when he/she starts the game
